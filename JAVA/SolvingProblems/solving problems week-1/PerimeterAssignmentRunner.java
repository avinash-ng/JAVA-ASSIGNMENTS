/**
1. Complete writing the method getNumPoints that has one parameter s that is of type Shape. This method returns an integer that is the number of points in Shape s. Hint: You will need to iterate over all the points in the Shape S and count them.

2. Add code in the method testPerimeter to call getNumPoints and to print the result.

3. Complete writing the method getAverageLength that has one parameter s that is of type Shape. This method returns a number of type double that is the calculated average of all the sidesâ€™ lengths in the Shape S.

4. Add code in the method testPerimeter to call the method getAverageLength and to print out the result. Note if you were to select the file example1.txt, then the average side length should be 4.0.

5. Complete writing the method getLargestSide that has one parameter s that is of type Shape. This method returns a number of type double that is the longest side in the Shape S.

6. Add code in the method testPerimeter to call the method getLargestSide and to print out the result. Note if you were to select the file example1.txt, then the longest side should be 5.0.

7. Complete writing the method getLargestX that has one parameter s that is of type Shape. This method returns a number of type double that is the largest x value over all the points in the Shape s.

8. Add code in the method testPerimeter to call the method getLargestX and to print out the result. Note if you were to select the file example1.txt, then the longest side should be 4.0.

/**
1. Complete writing the method getLargestPerimeterMultipleFiles that has no parameters. This method creates a DirectoryResource (so you can select multiple files) and then iterates over these files. For each File f, it converts the file into a FileResource with the line

    FileResource fr = new FileResource(f);

    Then it creates a Shape from the FileResource and calculates the shapes perimeter. What else does it need to do? It needs to return the the largest perimeter over all the shapes in the files you have selected.

2. Finish writing the void method testPerimeterMultipleFiles to call getLargestPerimeterMultipleFiles and to print out the largest such perimeter. This method has no parameters and no return value. You will select the files when you run this method (hint: see our documentation for the DirectoryResource class).

3. Finish writing the method getFileWithLargestPerimeter that has no parameters. This method should, like the getLargestPerimeterMultipleFiles method, create its own Directory Resource, except that this new method returns the File that has the largest such perimeter, so it has return type File.

4. Add code to the method testFileWithLargestPerimeter to call getFileWithLargestPerimeter. For the File that is returned, print the name of that file.
